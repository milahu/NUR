# rycee's NUR expressions

These are my NUR expressions, use them as you please. Don't blame me
if things break.

To make use of the things defined in this repository it is best to
first [install NUR][].

## Firefox Add-ons

This NUR repository provides a package set of Firefox extensions that
is updated daily. To list the available add-ons and see their
attribute names you can run

    $ nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -qaP -A nur.repos.rycee.firefox-addons

If you use one or more add-on that is not listed here then feel free
to open an issue. In the issue include links to the add-ons at
<https://addons.mozilla.org/>.
