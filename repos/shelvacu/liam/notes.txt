I think I can sort my email into these categories:
- A Top priority: should be a notification
  - personal emails
  - here is a code to login (except ms, ugh)
- B Normal priority: should be reviewed regularly, at least once every couple days
  - (some) purchase receipts
  - your credit card was used for <amount>
  - money stuff
  - patreons
- C Low priority: should be skimmed occaisionally to make sure nothing got caught that shouldn't have
  - C1 good emails:
    - your statement is available to view
    - 
  - C2 spam
- D Shit-tier: never reviewed, except if I'm missing an email I was otherwise expecting
  - unsolicited job offers
  - anything definitely spam

- M Mailing lists

searches should generally search A,B,C but not D or M
