    <h1>Jobs info</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I am currently looking to find a Software Engineering job. I am a
      professional developer specializing in Ruby on Rails and Rust, with over
      10 years of experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I want in a job:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Fully Remote</b> - that means 1 visit to an office per month or
          less. Strongly preferred; non-remote jobs will have to be very
          tempting in every other category.
        </li>
        <li>Prefer direct hire, but not required.</li>
        <li>W2 employment preferred, but also open to C2C/1099.</li>
        <li>
          While I could be productive in nearly any language, I would most like
          to work with Rust.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Things you probably want to know:

      <ul>
        <li>
          I am a US citizen (USC), for work authorization purposes I can work
          anywhere in the US.
        </li>
        <li>Open to both contract and permanent positions.</li>
        <li>I can start within a week.</li>
        <li>
          I do not have a formal degree, but more than enough experience to make
          up for it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Resume</h2>

      >You can see my latest, up-to-date resume here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>To send me job offers</h2>

    <p>
      Unfortunately I get a lot of bad job offers if I just give out my email to
      anyone. As such, I will only accept job offers sent using this form.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each time you want to send me an email about a new job offer, you must
      return to this page. The process may change from time to time. If you have
      multiple jobs you think I am a good fit for, please combine them in one
      email.
    </p>

    <form method="get" action="/email">
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          name="confirm_fully_remote_or_exceptional"
          value="yes"
          required
        >
        <span>This is a fully remote job, or you will give an exceptional reason
          why the offer should be considered despite not being fully
          remote.</span>
      </label>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          name="confirm_i_read_the_above"
          value="yes"
          required
        >
        <span>You have read the above and will not ask about work authorization
          status, earliest date to start, or formal education because you
          already have that information.</span>
      </label>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="confirm_include_pay" value="yes" required>
        <span>You will include an estimated pay range. No "depends on
          experience", my resume clearly shows how much experience I
          have.</span>
      </label>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          name="confirm_no_ask_resume"
          value="yes"
          required
        >
        <span>You will not ask for an updated resume. The latest resume is
          always available on this page.</span>
      </label>
      <label>
        <div>Your email:</div>
        <input type="email" name="email" required>
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <p>
      I apologize for the hassle. I promise that if you follow everything here
      before sending a job offer to me, I <i>will</i> respond, and I will make
      every effort to respond within 1 week.
