to add a host:
- create the new nix targets
  - hosts/by-name/HOST
  - let the toplevel (flake.nix) know about HOST
- build and flash an image
- optionally expand the rootfs
  - `cfdisk /dev/sda2` -> resize partition
  - `mount /dev/sda2 boot`
  - `btrfs filesystem resize max root`
- setup required persistent directories
  - `mkdir -p root/persist/private`
  - `gocryptfs -init root/persist/private`
  - then boot the device, and for every dangling symlink in ~/.local/share, ~/.cache, do `mkdir -p` on it
- setup host ssh
  - `mkdir -p root/persist/plaintext/etc/ssh/host_keys`
  - boot the machine and let it create its own ssh keys
  - add the pubkey to `hosts/common/hosts.nix`
- setup user ssh
  - `ssh-keygen`. don't enter any password; it's stored in a password-encrypted fs.
  - add the pubkey to `hosts/common/hosts.nix`
- allow the new host to view secrets
  - instructions in hosts/common/secrets.nix
  - run `ssh-to-age` on user/host pubkeys
  - add age key to .sops.yaml
  - update encrypted secrets: `sops updatekeys path/to/secret.yaml`
