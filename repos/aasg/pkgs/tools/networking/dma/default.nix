      The DragonFly Mail Agent is a small Mail Transport Agent (MTA),
      designed for home and office use.  It accepts mails from locally
      installed Mail User Agents (MUA) and delivers the mails either
      locally or to a remote destination.  Remote delivery includes
      several features like TLS/SSL support and SMTP authentication.

      dma is not intended as a replacement for real, big MTAs like
      sendmail(8) or postfix(1).  Consequently, dma does not listen
      on port 25 for incoming connections.
