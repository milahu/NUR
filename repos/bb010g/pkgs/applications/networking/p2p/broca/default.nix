      This is a proxy server that translates Synapse RPC into Transmission RPC.

      To use it, run the daemon and point your Transmission client at it. Set
      the username to your desired Synapse RPC URI (e.g. ws://localhost:8412)
      and the password to your Synapse RPC password, and the host to
      http://localhost:9091.
