## Using this repo

### Common

1. Install Cachix. This lets you use the pre-built binaries for these Nix expressions (built using Travis).
   1. ``$ nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install``
2. Use my cachix cache.
   1. ``$ cachix use drewrisinger``
3. Choose one of the two options below:

### As part of Nix User Repository

Follow the instructions on installation and package use at [GitHub NUR page](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR#installation)

### Standalone (my NUR packages only)

In a Nix script (example):
```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
let
  # Option 1 (recommended): Use Niv to manage versions
  # https://github.com/nmattia/niv/
  # niv add drewrisinger/nur-packages -n dr-nur-packages
  dr-nur-niv = pkgs.callPackage sources.dr-nur-packages { };

  # Option 2: get most recent version
  dr-nur-master = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/drewrisinger/nur-packages/archive/master.tar.gz") {
    inherit pkgs;
  };

  # Option 3: get a specific version
  dr-nur-at-commit = import (builtins.fetchTarball {
    # Get the revision by choosing a version from https://github.com/drewrisinger/nur-packages/commits/master
    url = "https://github.com/drewrisinger/nur-packages/archive/ffd7e82fa492ce9c52ffeabb8250c6182b96c482.tar.gz";
    # Get the hash by running `nix-prefetch-url --unpack <url>` on the above url
    sha256 = "1vs1z05k68hn3mvq8kh68c78zlp417p0bbxw20a9arjb9cdffckn";
  }) { inherit pkgs; };
in {
  dr-nur-niv.python3Packages.qiskit-terra;
  dr-nur-master.python3Packages.qiskit;
  dr-nur-at-commit.python3Packages.cirq;
}
```

## Common Problems

### Resolving Python Conflicts

This repository relies on overlaying certain Python packages to provide backwards-compatibility. E.g. qiskit requires scipy>1.4.0, which isn't in NixOS/nixpkgs 19.09, so I overlaid a new scipy version. However, this can cause conflicts if you're combining this repository with outside Python packages. To resolve this issue, do something like the following Nix script:

```nix
{ rawpkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  drew-nur-master = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/drewrisinger/nur-packages/archive/master.tar.gz") {
    inherit rawpkgs;
  };
  pkgs = drew-nur-master.pkgs;
  my-python-package = pkgs.python3Packages.callPackage ./PATH/TO/PACKAGE {
    # following line may be optional, but included for demonstration
    inherit (pkgs.python3Packages) scipy; inherit (drew-nur-master.python3Packages) qiskit;
  };
in
  (pkgs.python3.withPackages(ps: [ my-python-package ] )).env
```
