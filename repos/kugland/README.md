# Modules

## google-authenticator-singlesecret

**I’m not a security expert, so use this at your own risk.**

[**google-authenticator-singlesecret**](./modules/google-authenticator-singlesecret/) is a
module that overlays a patched version of `google-authenticator-libpam` that hardcodes the options
`secret`, `user` and `echo_verification_code` as a workaround to the NixOS module `security.pam`
inability to pass arbitrary options to the Google Authenticator PAM module.

With the original configuration, you can only use secrets stored at your own home directory and
readable by your own user, making it useless for `sudo` (the secret is readable by your user
*before* you acquire privileges). In this version, the secret is readable only by a single user
(default: `totp-auth`), and resides at this user’s home directory (default: `/var/lib/totp-auth`).

This setup only makes sense on a single-user system.

To use this module, add the following to your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  imports = [ pkgs.nur.repos.kugland.modules.google-authenticator-singlesecret ];
  security.pam.services.google-authenticator = {
    enable = true;
    #user = "totp-auth"; # Change the user name if you want
    #secret-dir = "/var/lib/totp-auth"; # Change the secret directory if you want
    echo = true; # If you want the verification code to be echoed to the terminal, I like it.
  };
  security = {
    sudo = {
      enable = true;
      # For some reason, with this config sudo lectures us every time, let's suppress it.
      extraConfig = ''Defaults lecture="never"'';
    };
    pam.services = {
      # Now enable Google Authenticator for su and sudo :-)
      su.googleAuthenticator.enable = true; # enable 2FA for su
      sudo.googleAuthenticator.enable = true; # enable 2FA for sudo
    };
  };
}
```

After adding this and rebuilding your system, you **MUST** run `setup-google-authenticator-singlesecret.sh`
as root to configure the secret for the user you specified. If you don’t, you will not be able
to easily `sudo` again.
