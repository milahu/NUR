# My NUR packages

These are some of my personal packages.  
Feel free to use them but do so at you own risk.  

### What is this?!

These are Expressions for the [Nix](https://nixos.org) Package Manager.  
These specific ones are available in the [Nix User Repository (NUR)](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR)  

If you want to create your own NUR repository check out this [Template](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR)
