    In nixpkgs vimPlugins is an overridable, recursive attribute set.
    This means it can be extended like so:

    myVimPlugins = pkgs.vimPlugins.extend config.nur.repo.mikilio.vimPlugins;

    This overlay is intended for this use-case only and alternative use is not supported.
    The decision to provide vimPlugins as an overlay is to enable seamless integration
    with other plugins.
