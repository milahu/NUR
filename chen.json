It takes as input a definition of a language syntax and\nsemantics, in a concise and readable ASCII notation that is close to\nwhat one would write in informal mathematics. It generates LaTeX to\nbuild a typeset version of the definition, and Coq, HOL, and Isabelle\nversions of the definition. Additionally, it can be run as a filter,\ntaking a LaTeX/Coq/Isabelle/HOL source file with embedded (symbolic)\nterms of the defined language, parsing them and replacing them by\ntarget-system terms.\n","mainProgram":"ott","maintainers":[{"email":"i@cuichen.cc","github":"cu1ch3n","githubId":80438676,"name":"Chen Cui"}],"name":"ott-sweirich-unstable-2022-04-07","outputsToInstall":["out"],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd13","x86_64-freebsd13","x86_64-solaris","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","loongarch64-linux","m68k-linux","microblaze-linux","microblazeel-linux","mips-linux","mips64-linux","mips64el-linux","mipsel-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox"],"position":"/nix/store/wkgfcjn91bqfjz44fwy6hb84yvck1pk4-source/pkgs/ott-sweirich/default.nix:31","unfree":false,"unsupported":false},"name":"ott-sweirich-unstable-2022-04-07","outputName":"out","outputs":{"out":null},"pname":"ott-sweirich-unstable","system":"x86_64-linux","version":"2022-04-07"}}}
