trace: evaluation warning: fontforge-20230101 was overridden with `version` but not `src` at ./default.nix:773:5.

This is most likely not what you want. In order to properly change the version of a package, override
both the `version` and `src` attributes:

hello.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: rec {
  version = "1.0.0";
  src = pkgs.fetchurl {
    url = "mirror://gnu/hello/hello-${version}.tar.gz";
    hash = "...";
  };
})

(To silence this warning, set `__intentionallyOverridingVersion = true` in your `overrideAttrs` call.)
